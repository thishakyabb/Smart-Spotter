# Smart-Spotter
Due to the ongoing economic crisis in Sri Lanka, people are facing financial difficulties and as a result, the rate of robberies has been increased. This Article focus on the development and implementation of a smart key tag to track our personal items using Atmega328P Microcontroller, HC-06 Bluetooth Wireless Module, analog components, and ICs. The goal of this project is to implement a working smart spotter with 2 key feature modes named Finder mode and Security mode.

Smart spotter is a fully functional programmable smart key tag with an active piezo buzzer as sound output. Atmel Atmega328P handles storage, processing, and input/output tasks. HC-06 Bluetooth Wireless Serial Module is used for the wireless communication between the smart spotter and the userâ€™s smartphone. 2 in series Li-Po batteries are added to power the smart spotter.
